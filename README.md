## Descriptions
PoLIM is a 2D flowband thermomechanical ice flow model. It uese Blatter-Pattyn higher-order approximations and describes the energy transportation using the enthalpy method. It is designed for the simulation of mountain glaciers dynamics, and can be used to model the polythermal structure of the moutain glacier.

PoLIM is validated using the ISMIP-HOM benchmark experiments and Kleiner's enthalpy benchmark experiments. PoLIM also implements the Schoof-Hewitt water transportation scheme in temperate ice and a cavity-sheet subglacial hydrology model.

A paper describes PoLIM is prepared and will be soon submitted.
