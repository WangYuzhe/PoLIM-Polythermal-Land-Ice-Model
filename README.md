## Descriptions
PoLIM is a 2D flowband thermomechanical ice flow model. It uses Blatter-Pattyn higher-order approximations and describes the energy transportation using the enthalpy method. It is designed for modeling the dynamics of mountain glaciers, and can be used to model the polythermal structures of moutain glaciers.

PoLIM is validated by the ISMIP-HOM benchmark experiments and Kleiner's enthalpy benchmark experiments. PoLIM also implements the Schoof-Hewitt water transportation scheme in temperate ice and a cavity-sheet subglacial hydrology model.

## Features
* PoLIM implements an enthalpy-based thermal model which is particularly convenient to simulate the dynamics of polythermal glaciers.
* PoLIM includes a drainage model to simulate the water transport in the temperate ice layer driven by gravity.
* PoLIM includes a subglacial hydrology model to simulate the subglacial water pressure for the coupling with the basal sliding law.

  abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of glaciers is essential for the knowledge of global sea-level rise, local freshwater resources in high mountain and arid regions, and the potential glacial hazards. In this paper, we present a two-dimensional thermomechanically coupled ice flow model named PoLIM (Polythermal Land Ice Model). The velocity solver of PoLIM is developed based on the Blatterâ€“Pattyn approximation of Stokes flow. It uses an enthalpy formulation of the energy balance, an approach that is suitable for modeling the polythermal glaciers. PoLIM also includes a scheme for gravity-driven drainage of water in temperate ice, a subglacial hydrology model coupled with ice dynamics, and multiple basal sliding laws. The model has been verified by standard benchmark problems, including the ISMIP-HOM experiments, the enthalpy benchmark experiments, and the SHMIP experiments. PoLIM shows good performances and agrees well with these benchmark results, indicating its robust capability of simulating the thermomechanical behaviors of glaciers.},
