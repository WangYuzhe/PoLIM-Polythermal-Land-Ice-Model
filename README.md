## Descriptions
PoLIM is a 2D first-order flowband thermomechanical ice flow model. It is designed for modeling the dynamics and thermodynamics of mountain glaciers particularly for polythermal glaciers.

PoLIM has been verified by standard benchmark problems, including the ISMIP-HOM experiments, the enthalpy benchmark experiments, and the SHMIP experiments. PoLIM shows good performances and agrees well with these benchmark results, indicating its robust capability of simulating the thermomechanical behaviors of glaciers.

## Features
* PoLIM simplifies the momentum balance using the Blatterâ€“Pattyn approximation.
* PoLIM implements an enthalpy formulation of the energy balance equation.
* PoLIM includes a scheme for gravity-driven drainage of water in temperate ice.
* PoLIM couples a cavity-sheet type subglacial hydrology model to ice dynamics.
